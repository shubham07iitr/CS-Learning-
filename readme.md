# What is this 

This is my attempt at learning fundamentals of Computers Science degree (including ML) as taught in a bachelor's course + some additional applications of CS courses as a non CS grad. Most of the courses have been taken up as suggested by the [OSSU curriculum ](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science?tab=readme-ov-file#core-cs). Some other courses/resources cover the fundamentals as suggested by [teachyourselfcs curriculum](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) and some courses are just generic application courses such as ML or web development, or introductory courses

# Organisation

## Folder Structure

Computer Science
├── Module1-Intro to CS
├── Module2-Core Programming
├── Module3-Core Maths
├── Module4-Core Systems
├── Module5-Core Theory
├── Module6-Core Applications
├── Module7-Advanced Courses
├── Module8-Advanced Courses
├── Module9-ML
└── readme.md


## Other points on structure
- Curicullum is organised into modules and each module will have:
    - OSSU Courses
    - Non OSSU courses (if applicable)
- Each course folder would have roughly 3-4 folders and files:
    - Course Notes as provided by the instructor
    - Course Notes taken by me (more detailed and will cover a lot of random topics which intrigued me during the course) - generally at the top of the folder
    - Exercises of the course (Most of it completed)
    - Lecture Codes (For coding discussion during lectures)
