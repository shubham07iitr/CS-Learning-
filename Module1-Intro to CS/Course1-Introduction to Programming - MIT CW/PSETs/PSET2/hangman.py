    Starts up an interactive game of Hangman.
    * At the start of the game, let the user know how many
      letters the secret_word contains and how many guesses they start with.
    * The user should start with 10 guesses.
    * Before each round, you should display to the user how many guesses
      they have left and the letters that the user has not yet guessed.
    * Ask the user to supply one guess per round. Remember to make
      sure that the user puts in a single letter (or help character '!'
      for with_help functionality)
    * If the user inputs an incorrect consonant, then the user loses ONE guess,
      while if the user inputs an incorrect vowel (a, e, i, o, u),
      then the user loses TWO guesses.
    * The user should receive feedback immediately after each guess
      about whether their guess appears in the computer's word.
    * After each guess, you should display to the user the
      partially guessed word so far.
    -----------------------------------
    with_help functionality
    -----------------------------------
    * If the guess is the symbol !, you should reveal to the user one of the
      letters missing from the word at the cost of 3 guesses. If the user does
      not have 3 guesses remaining, print a warning message. Otherwise, add
      this letter to their guessed word and continue playing normally.

    Follows the other limitations detailed in the problem write-up.
